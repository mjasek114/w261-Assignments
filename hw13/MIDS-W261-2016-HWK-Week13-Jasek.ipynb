    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",

    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",

In particular, please look at how the tools of machine learning are used to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. Please share any useful graphs/analysis you come up with via the group email. For example, pick the top two most important variables and plot the separating hyperplane in this 2D space that is generated using an SVM (or logistic regression model or plot both; are they similar?) that is learnt using those two features only. Comment on your observations. Please feel free to come up other graphs/analysis (e.g., clustering the passengers). \n",
