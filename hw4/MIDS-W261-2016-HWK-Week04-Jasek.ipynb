    "Here you will use a different dataset consisting of word-frequency distributions for 1,000 Twitter users. These Twitter users use language in very different ways, and were classified by hand according to the criteria:\n",
    "0: Human, where only basic human-human communication is observed.\n",
    "1: Cyborg, where language is primarily borrowed from other sources (e.g., jobs listings, classifieds postings, advertisements, etc...).\n",
    "2: Robot, where language is formulaically derived from unrelated sources (e.g., weather/seismology, police/fire event logs, etc...).\n",

    "HW4.6 (OPTIONAL) Scaleable K-MEANS++\n",
    "Over half a century old and showing no signs of aging, k-means remains one of the most popular data processing algorithms. As is well-known, a proper initialization of k-means is crucial for obtaining a good final solution. The recently proposed k-means++ initialization algorithm achieves this, obtaining an initial set of centers that is provably close to the optimum solution. A major downside of the k-means++ is its inherent sequential nature, which limits its applicability to massive data: one must make k passes over the data to find a good initial set of centers. The paper listed below shows how to drastically reduce the number of passes needed to obtain, in parallel, a good initialization. This is unlike prevailing efforts on parallelizing k-means that have mostly focused on the post-initialization phases of k-means. The proposed initialization algorithm k-means|| obtains a nearly optimal solution after a logarithmic number of passes; the paper also shows that in practice a constant number of passes suffices. Experimental evaluation on realworld large-scale data demonstrates that k-means|| outperforms k-means++ in both sequential and parallel settings.\n",

    "HW4.7 (OPTIONAL) Canopy Clustering\n",
    "An alternative way to intialize the k-means algorithm is the canopy clustering. The canopy clustering algorithm is an unsupervised pre-clustering algorithm introduced by Andrew McCallum, Kamal Nigam and Lyle Ungar in 2000. It is often used as preprocessing step for the K-means algorithm or the Hierarchical clustering algorithm. It is intended to speed up clustering operations on large data sets, where using another algorithm directly may be impractical due to the size of the data set.\n",
