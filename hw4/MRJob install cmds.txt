Required changes for new versions
More trivially (from sharmila.velamur email):
1.  I had to change the filename in %%writefile to WordCount (this was
mr_wc.py instead in the downloaded notebook) when working with MrjobWordCount.
2.  I also had to change MRJobStep to MRStep.

On windows machine
#In Anaconda python 2.7 environment
activate python27
pip install mrjob

On Softlayer server
# AS ROOT USER, NOT HADOOP USER
pip install mrjob
# output:  Successfully built filechunkio httplib2 oauth2client uritemplate
