HOMEWORK GRADING INSTRUCTIONS for MIDS Machine Learning at Scale (261)
Version 2016-01-22


This document is in reference to grading of Homeworks for the MIDS Machine Learning at Scale using a peer grading process. To make this document concrete we will use to HW1 as prototypical reference. We welcome your input and feedback as we refine this process of peer grading for future homeworks. 

The Master solution for HW1 is available at:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvqbfahzp6qvh3l/HW1-Master-Solution.ipynb?dl=0


You will all be expected to grade N (three or four) notebook submissions from your fellow students. Please check the document linked here for your grading assignments and to see who is on your grading team (typically 3 ot 4 fellow students).

-- Note each student is assigned to a group (check the "HW1 Grading Group" column). Email your group members and introduce yourselves immediately.
-- Each group needs to grade all submissions that have been assigned to your group members 


Next let's talk  GRADING Instructions:

For HW1 the following questions will be considered as part of your grade. As such, ONLY these question need to be graded (please review your responses to other questions in your own time):

-- HW1.0.0,  HW1.0.1 and HW1.3

Guidance for grading: 


-- For HW1, questions HW1.0.0 and  HW1.0.1 should cover similar points that are in the master solution (and as we have discussed in class). 
-- As for grading HW1.3, I am looking for a misclassification error rate of approximately 0.39. In addition, we are looking for one Map-Reduce job (possibly 2 map reduce jobs if the classification task is separated into a second map-reduce job). The general flow should be similar to the master
-- Style: if a submission is missing the question part of a HW question in the selected subset of questions (please deduct 50% for the style part of the HW). Please also pay attention to ease of reading. Zero comments  means 50% penalty in style; if sparse comments, please grade accordingly

Each of the following should receive a grade in the range [0-100]%. 

-- Style	
-- HW1.0	
-- HW1.3	

If a question has more than one part please treat part equally.

ACTION ITEMS for each Notebook Submission assigned to you for grading:

-- Please download/view each notebook. 
-- Compare the answers in the submission to the answers in the Master notebook. Run the notebook locally if necessary. Please read and compare the responses in both notebooks carefully. 
-- Grade each question according to correctness in the range [0-100]%
-- Once you have graded all three submissions assigned to you, please coordinate with the other students in your group (who have been assigned the same submissions) to meet. 
-- Reserve a time slot peer grading disucssion IMMEDIATELY. Put the agreed time in a calendar invite to each other.
-- During this grading review meeting, please review each of the assigned homework submissions. As part of this review, please review and discuss each others grade assignments for each question. Please limit your discussion to the questions selected for grading for that homework. If there is consensus in the assigned grades, please review that question quickly. If, however, there is a big disagreement (>10%) please take time to discuss. If after a discussion there is still no agreement please alert me and I will work with you to reconcile differences. 

For each graded homework submission, once you have agreed on the grade for each question, please input final grades and other information using this Grading form located here:

SCHEDULE:
Please upload homework grades by ** Sunday night at 8PM **. Once I review your grade assignments (and the occasional spot check), I will share with each student their attained grade.

ETHICS
-- Collusion, unfairness, or accomodations of any sort will be grounds for dismissal from this course. Instructors will be spot checking your grading work. Please refer any issues to the course instructors.
